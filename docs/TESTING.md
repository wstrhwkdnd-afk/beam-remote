# Testing Beam Remote

## Automated checks

Run `./gradlew assembleDebug testDebugUnitTest lintDebug`.

Unit tests verify Samsung power and NEC power wire vectors, LG full-state and off vectors, all 375 combinations of supported AC temperature/mode/fan values with both timing variants, checksums, timing bounds, defensive signal copying, invalid raw input, catalog serialization, custom AC scenes, unknown schema versions, and malformed imports.

Unit tests cannot prove that an OEM IR driver emits accurate timings or that an appliance accepts a candidate code. A debug build and emulator run also cannot prove IR compatibility.

## Emulator / no-emitter checks

1. Launch with clean app data. Devices shows an empty state; Preview defaults on.
2. Add a Samsung TV, press Power. The result must say “Preview only” and “Nothing transmitted”.
3. Add an LG AC. Set 25°C, another mode and fan. Nothing is sent until Apply. Try Apply and Off in Preview.
4. Navigate away, rotate/recreate, force-stop and relaunch: profiles, selected device, preview preference, and AC draft settings should survive. No automatic command should be sent.
5. Edit metadata. Export to a local document, import it, and verify the commands and metadata. Import must add a distinct profile, not overwrite one.
6. Add a raw command; reject zero/negative/non-numeric durations, duplicate names, and a ≥2-second pattern. Delete a command and device and relaunch to check persistence.
7. Turn Preview off on an emulator and try Power. Expect an explicit no-emitter error, never “Signal sent”.
8. Test large fonts, small screen, landscape, screen reader labels, navigation-bar insets, and long command labels. Content must scroll rather than hide controls behind the keyboard/system bars.
9. Cancel file pickers and dialogs. Test invalid JSON, unknown schema version, fractional durations, over-512-KB import, inaccessible file provider, and empty command sets. Existing profiles must remain intact.

## Physical phone and appliance matrix

Use a real Android phone with an IR emitter exposed through `ConsumerIrManager`. Start at roughly 0.5–1 m with clear line of sight. Do not infer emitter failure from a camera test alone; some cameras filter infrared.

| Record | Example / expected observation |
| --- | --- |
| Phone / Android / build | Manufacturer, exact model, Android version and build |
| IR status | Help reports emitter present; note carrier ranges or unknown |
| Appliance | Brand, exact model, and original remote model |
| Profile | Candidate family or raw capture source |
| Command | Power / volume / complete AC state |
| App result | Sent / unsupported frequency / hardware error |
| Appliance result | Actual observed response; do not substitute “sent” |
| Reliability | Responses out of 10 attempts, distance and angle |

TV: test power once, volume up/down, mute, channel, input and navigation. Allow the appliance to settle between power tests; toggles can undo a prior press. Record unsupported buttons separately.

AC: test explicit Off, Cool 24°C Auto, temperatures 16/30, all supported modes and fan levels appropriate to the appliance. Some units have no heating capability even if the protocol can encode it. Confirm full-state replacement after using the original remote. Test LG28 and LG2 only against matching remote families. Do not assume swing or timers work; they are intentionally absent.

For custom AC scenes, capture complete known-good frames using a separate IR receiver (for example an Arduino/ESP receiver). Compare received frequency/timings and decoded state with the original remote. ConsumerIrManager cannot receive or learn signals. If a frame needs repeats, include them with their gaps within the API's duration limit.

## Troubleshooting

- **No emitter:** public Android API unavailable, missing hardware, or OEM-only driver. The app cannot fix that with a permission prompt.
- **Sent, no response:** wrong model/code family, obstructed IR window, wrong orientation/range, carrier mismatch, or missing protocol repeats. “Sent” only means the API call returned.
- **Unsupported carrier:** use a compatible phone or a verified code using a supported carrier; changing the frequency arbitrarily will not repair a code.
- **AC changed unexpectedly:** a raw capture includes full state; label the scene with all settings. UI state is not feedback from the appliance.
- **Corrupt saved data:** the app preserves the existing preference data and blocks overwriting it. Restore an exported profile after clearing storage only if you accept losing the unreadable local data.

## Run record

See `VALIDATION.md` for the checks actually completed for this delivery. Physical phone/appliance tests remain pending until hardware is available.

## Whirlpool acceptance checks

- Add both Whirlpool candidates and confirm temperature limits: 18–32°C for 3A/04, 16–30°C for 91. Verify Cool/Dry/Fan/Heat and Auto/Low/Medium/High fan lists; no unsupported 6th Sense option.
- In Preview, Apply and Power each show a 38 kHz / 343-duration signal. Changing controls alone must not send. Inspect a receiver capture: Apply must have the toggle bit clear, Power must set it and use command category 1. Apply after Power must clear it again.
- Restart and export/import after selecting Heat, Low fan and a boundary temperature. The model, values and last-command category should survive; no power toggle should be persisted or transmitted automatically.
- On matching physical hardware, test a single Power toggle and confirm response, then Apply a different temperature without toggling power. Verify modes/fans and both model variants only on compatible units. Check for required repeat behavior, inter-section timing and carrier compatibility.
- Test with previously enabled timers/special modes: basic frames carry those flags off. No claim is made that these advanced settings are preserved.
- Regression: existing LG controls retain explicit Off and On/Apply behavior, and existing TV/raw profiles remain usable.
